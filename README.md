# Lip-Sync-Using-Wav2Lip
This GitHub repository contains a Python project for lip synchronization using the Wav2Lip model. The project's primary goal is to create lip-synced videos with high accuracy by aligning audio and video content. Additionally, the repository provides a solution to handle scenarios where faces are not visible in specific segments of a video.

*Features:*
1. Lip synchronization using the state-of-the-art Wav2Lip model.
2. Accurate alignment of audio and video content.
3. Handling scenarios where faces are not visible in certain video segments.
4. Creation of seamless lip-synced videos with audio.

*Usage:*
1. Upload your video and audio files from Google Drive.
2. Run the code sequentially from first to last cell.
3. Ignore the warnings if any.

*Requirements:*
1. Python
2. OpenCV for video and face processing
3. Wav2Lip model (external download or integration)
4. MoviePy for video editing
5. Recommended to us GOOGLE COLAB with a support for GPU for faster execution.


Contributions and improvements to the project are welcome. If you have suggestions, bug fixes, or enhancements, feel free to contribute to the repository.
